 Activate Uptown will take place right in the streets, along Artesia Boulevard
 and Myrtle Avenue. Artesia Boulevard will be open to people walking, biking,
 and playing in the street, and closed to car traffic. Myrtle Avenue will
 showcase a reimagined streetscape with temporary features (including a bike
 boulevard and traffic circle) that make walking, biking, or skating easier,
 safer and more enjoyable. Come check them out! Activate Uptown is brought to
 you by Vice Mayor Rex Richardson, SCAGâ€™sGo Human Campaign,
 Clean Transportation Funding - MSRC, and The California Endowment.
